		<h2 style="font-family: georgia">Elton John's Candle in the Wind</h2>
	<h3> <img src="Assets/EltonJohn.jfif" style=" float: inherit; width: 288px; height: 235px" alt="EltonJohn">In the year of 1997, I (Mitchell Zook) was born. It was a cold autumn night when I came into the world and Elton John's 1997 release of Candle in the Wind was going into its second week as the number one song. Truly it was a time to be alive. Elton John has been a prolific music maker and has contributed much to the catalogue of rock and pop however, he also made a song that I absolutely despise with every fiber of my being. That song is Crocodile Rock; it is one of three songs in all of the music that I have listened to in my life that I abhor. The other two for curious minds are Come on Eileen by Dexy’s Midnight Runners and Pompei by Bastille. So in a way I guess I’m kind of disappointed that a song by Elton John is the top song the week I was born but I guess he also made Benny and the Jets which is one of my favorite songs so I guess its all a wash. Honestly though fuck crocodile rock. </h3>
